## SATURN-EDU2</br>

**SATURN** is finite element software packages written in FORTRAN 95 for linear palnestress analysis. **SATURN-EDU2** can be used for the educational purpose. It will be converted to Python packages soon!</br></br>

## Features</br>
* Planestress condition finite element</br>
* LU decomposition solver with full global stiffness matrix</br>
* Free and open source ([GNU General Public License, version 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html/))</br></br>

## Compiling from the source code</br>
```git clone https://github.com/hmjeon/SATURN-EDU2.git```</br>

**Requirements to compile from source:**</br>
[Intel Fortran compiler](https://software.intel.com/en-us/fortran-compilers): Intel Parallel Studio XE 2016, 2017, 2018, or 2019</br>

- Compiling the SATURN-EDU2 sources require [Intel Fortran](https://software.intel.com/en-us/fortran-compilers). Free Intel (R) Software Development Tools are available for qualified students, educators, academic researchers and open source contributors, see the [details](https://software.intel.com/en-us/qualify-for-free-software/).</br>
- The Intel Fortran compiler supports all of the features of the Fortran 90, Fortran 95, Fortran 2003 standards and most of Fortran 2008. It also supports some draft Fortran 2018 features.
